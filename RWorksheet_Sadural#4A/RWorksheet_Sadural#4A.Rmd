## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#6. Full Search 
#Exhaustive search is a methodology for finding an answer by exploring all possible cases.When trying to find a desired number in a set of given numbers, the method of finding the corresponding number by checking all elements in the set one by one can be called an exhaustive search. Implement an exhaustive search function that meets the input/outputconditions below.

exhaustive_search <- function(selected_number) {
  if (selected_number < 1 || selected_number > 50) {
    return("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50")
  } else if (selected_number == 20) {
    return(TRUE)
  } else {
    return(selected_number)
  }
}

random_selected_number <- (1:50, 1)

cat("Randomly selected number: ",random)

user_input <- as.numeric(readline("Enter a number: "))

result <-exhaustive_search(user_input)

cat("Result: ", result, "\n")
