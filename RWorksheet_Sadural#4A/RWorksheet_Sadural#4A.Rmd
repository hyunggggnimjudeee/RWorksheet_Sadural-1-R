# Yes, because if your height is small, then your shoe size is small. And if your height is big then your shoe size is big too

#6. Full Search 
#Exhaustive search is a methodology for finding an answer by exploring all possible cases.When trying to find a desired number in a set of given numbers, the method of finding the corresponding number by checking all elements in the set one by one can be called an exhaustive search. Implement an exhaustive search function that meets the input/output conditions below.
